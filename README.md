# hello-world

My name is Danny Hinton and I have been in management for over 20 years.
I currently run both a wholesale company and a chain of retail stores in Kentucky.
In the past 20 years I have automated both systems to the extent of my capabilities.
I have decided to learn python and other languages in order to finish the system automations and semi retire from my current positions.
My goal is to start a new career in coding with my knowledge.
